# Dependencies
Please install *Python 3.10.6* before you install the dependencies. If you already have an earlier version of Python installed, please upgrade your version.

You need to install the following packages on your machine or a virtual environment to run the website using the following pip commands:
- ```pip install django``` (for web development)
- ```pip install pysentimiento``` (for sentiment analysis using the BERT model)
- ```pip install vaderSentiment``` (for sentiment analysis the VADER lexicon)

## A note on virtual environments
As much as possible, use ```venv``` as the name of your virtual environment. If you want to use another name, please add the name of your folder to the repository's ```.gitignore``` file.

# Documentations / Tutorials
For Django tutorials, I recommend Corey Schafer's YouTube tutorials that covers a lot of the features of Django, as well as Bootstrap 4 for designing the website. Supplemental readings can be found on Django's official website.
